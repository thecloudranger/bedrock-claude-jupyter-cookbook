# Amazon Bedrock Claude Integration Notebook

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to interact with Anthropic's Claude model through Amazon Bedrock. It includes various test scenarios showing different capabilities of the language model.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Lab
- AWS Account with Bedrock access
- AWS CLI configured

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Required Software**
   ```bash
   # Install Jupyter Lab
   pip install jupyterlab

   # Install required packages
   pip install boto3
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials**
   
   Before running the notebook, set up your AWS credentials in the terminal:
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Use AWS CLI
   aws configure
   # Enter your:
   # - AWS Access Key ID
   # - AWS Secret Access Key
   # - Default region (e.g., us-east-1)
   # - Default output format (json)

   # Option 2: Set environment variables
   export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
   export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
   export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   ```

3. **Launch Jupyter Lab**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. **Open the Notebook**
   - Navigate to `bedrock.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab
   - The notebook contains several test scenarios:
     - Basic Question Answering
     - Code Generation
     - Text Summarization
     - Creative Writing
     - Data Analysis

## Notebook Structure

The notebook demonstrates various capabilities:
- Setting up Bedrock client
- Basic model invocation
- Different prompt types and responses
- Temperature adjustment for creativity
- Handling different types of content (code, text, analysis)

## Test Scenarios

1. **Basic Question Answering**: Tests the model's ability to answer general questions
2. **Code Generation**: Generates Python code based on requirements
3. **Text Summarization**: Demonstrates text compression capabilities
4. **Creative Writing**: Shows creative capabilities with temperature adjustment
5. **Data Analysis**: Tests analytical capabilities with sample data

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary AWS permissions to access Bedrock
- The model used is `anthropic.claude-v2`
- Default parameters:
  - max_tokens: 500
  - temperature: 0.7

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:
1. Verify AWS credentials are properly configured
2. Check if your AWS region has Bedrock service available
3. Ensure you have the correct permissions in your AWS account
4. Verify your boto3 version is up to date

## Cost Considerations

- Be aware that using Amazon Bedrock incurs costs based on usage
- Monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider implementing rate limiting for production use

## Security Notes

- Never commit AWS credentials to version control
- Use AWS best practices for credential management
- Consider using AWS IAM roles when possible
